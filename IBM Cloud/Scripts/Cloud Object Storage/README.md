## üìÇ Current Scripts

### 1. **Dry Run COS Cleanup Script**
- **Description**: Simulates the cleanup process by identifying COS instances and their associated keys based on a specific naming pattern (e.g., `example-*`). This ensures the correct resources are targeted before proceeding with deletion.
- **Purpose**: Helps verify selected instances and keys to avoid unintended deletions.

### 2. **COS Cleanup Script**
- **Description**: Deletes the specified COS instances and their associated keys. This script is used after verifying the resources through the dry run.
- **Purpose**: Automates the cleanup process for obsolete or unnecessary COS resources.
- **Caution**: This operation is irreversible; ensure you‚Äôve reviewed the resources carefully.
